# RareImpAnnotation

The first file to run is the generate_inputs.sh file. Paths for the appropriate sofware packages (plink2, BGENIX, cat-bgen) should be inserted in the correct places in this script. 

Then the ld_annotate.py script should be run. This requires a number of annotation files from databases listed as arguments at the beginning of the program.

All scripts should be in the same directory as the bgen/sample and BOLT-LMM output files unless paths are otherwise specified.
